                <h3>A Brief History of F1 Car Evolution</h3>
                <p>Formula 1 cars have transformed dramatically since the sport's inception in 1950. Early cars were front-engined behemoths with minimal safety features and basic aerodynamics.</p>
                <p>The 1960s and 70s saw the rise of rear-engined designs, the introduction of aerodynamic wings, and ground-effect technology, which massively increased cornering speeds. The 1980s was the turbo era, with engines producing well over 1,000 horsepower. Today, we are in the hybrid era, featuring incredibly complex power units that combine a traditional engine with advanced energy recovery systems.</p>

                <h3>Anatomy of a Sub-Two-Second Pit Stop</h3>
                <p>A modern F1 pit stop is a marvel of teamwork and precision. Here are the key steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Driver stops with pinpoint accuracy at the pit box.</li>
                    <li>Front and rear jacks lift the car instantly.</li>
                    <li>Wheel gun operators remove all four wheels simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>New tires are fitted by another set of crew members.</li>
                    <li>Jacks are dropped and the driver is released.</li>
                </ol>
