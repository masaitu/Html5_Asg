00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.000
The safety car is coming in at the end of this lap. We're going to have one lap of racing to decide the championship.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hamilton has the advantage. Verstappen has the faster, fresher tires.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.500
And we have got 3.2 miles of racing action all the way to the checkered flag as the crowd roar the drivers on to the final lap of this race. And Verstappen sets after Hamilton.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.000
Is it going to be a first world championship for Verstappen? Is it going to be an eighth world championship for Lewis Hamilton?

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.500
Where can Verstappen try and get past Hamilton? First overtaking zone is normally down in the turn five.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.500
Is Verstappen far enough back? He's going to make the lunge down the inside. Hamilton sees it coming. It's a late lunge by Verstappen who takes the lead in the race.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.500
Verstappen now snatches the championship trophy from Lewis Hamilton who's trying to fight back.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.500
No DRS for two laps. So Lewis Hamilton will not get the rear wing open.

00:00:58.800 --> 01:06.000
Now he's going to go down the outside... if he keeps it tight and neat. But he hasn't. He's gone a little bit wide.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.800
No Mikey. No. No Mikey. That was so not right.

01:13.500 --> 01:18.000
Here comes Lewis Hamilton though down the back straight. He's got a slipstream.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.000
He almost touches Verstappen. They almost make contact into turn nine.

01:21.300 --> 01:24.000
Verstappen stays ahead of Lewis Hamilton.

01:24.300 --> 01:32.500
Of all the drama, of all the controversy, of all the magic moments in Formula 1 in 2021, it comes down to this.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.500
And at this moment, it looks like it's going to go the way of Max Verstappen.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.500
Mercedes not happy. Red Bull will be delighted.

01:40.800 --> 01:48.500
They have shared a brilliant championship battle, but the championship can only be won by one.

01:48.800 --> 01:56.000
And it's going Dutch in 2021. Max Verstappen, for the first time ever, is champion of the world.
